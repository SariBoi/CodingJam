# Pomodoro Scheduling App - Project Organization

Based on our detailed discussion, here's a comprehensive organization of the Pomodoro Scheduling App project. I've made sure to include all aspects we've discussed while providing a structured approach for your 48-hour hackathon.

## 1. Project Overview

**Core Concept:** A web-based Pomodoro timer app with task scheduling capabilities, designed for students to manage their study time effectively.

**Key Differentiator:** Tasks are split into individual Pomodoro sessions on the calendar view, rather than showing tasks as single time blocks.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Platform Choice
Based on our discussion, a **web-based application** is the most suitable approach:
- Can be hosted on GitHub Pages (free and easy deployment)
- No installation required for users
- Works across devices
- Supports browser notifications API
- Allows for responsive design

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** 
  - Minimal external dependencies for hackathon timeline
  - Optional: Small calendar library if time permits
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Background Processing:** Web Workers for timer reliability
- **Notifications:** Web Notifications API

## 3. Core Functionality Specifications

### Task Management

**Task Data Model:**
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  name: "Task Name",                 // Only required field
  estimatedDuration: 90,             // In minutes
  dueDateTime: "2025-05-10T14:00:00", // Optional
  startDateTime: "2025-05-10T12:30:00", // Optional, calculated if not provided
  priority: 1,                       // 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
  status: "pending",                 // "pending", "ongoing", "completed", "partial", "missed"
  reminderTime: "2025-05-10T11:30:00", // Default: 1hr before start
  customTimerSettings: {             // Optional, uses defaults if not specified
    focusTime: 25,                   // Minutes
    breakTime: 5                     // Minutes
  },
  procrastinationMode: false,        // Break first, then focus
  recurringPattern: ["Monday", "Thursday"], // Days when task repeats (empty if not recurring)
  tags: ["Study", "Math"],           // Optional categories
  sessions: [                        // Generated from estimatedDuration
    {
      id: "session-1",
      type: "focus",                 // "focus" or "break"
      startTime: "2025-05-10T12:30:00",
      duration: 25,                  // Minutes
      completed: false
    },
    {
      id: "session-2",
      type: "break",
      startTime: "2025-05-10T12:55:00",
      duration: 5,
      completed: false
    },
    // More sessions...
  ],
  progress: {
    completedSessions: 0,
    totalSessions: 6                 // Calculated based on estimatedDuration and timer settings
  },
  focusModeEnabled: false,           // Full-screen focus mode
  autoResume: false                  // Auto-continue to next session
}
```

**Session Calculation Algorithm:**
- A 90-minute task with default settings (25|5) generates 3 complete Pomodoro cycles (25+5+25+5+25+5)
- Round up partial time periods
- Last session will always be a focus session of standard duration
- Include an "extend" button and "end task" button for all sessions

**Task Status Management:**
- **Pending:** Tasks that haven't been started yet
- **Ongoing:** Task currently in progress (focus or break)
- **Partial:** Task started but paused and not completed
- **Completed:** Task finished (all sessions completed or manually ended)
- **Missed:** Task not started by its scheduled time (highlighted in red)

**Task Priority System:**
- Visual color coding for different priorities
- Higher priority tasks shown first in Task View when sharing start times
- Notification when a higher priority task starts while a lower priority task is in progress

### Timer Functionality

**Timer Components:**
- Focus timer (default: 25 minutes)
- Break timer (default: 5 minutes)
- Timer display with visual countdown
- Start/Pause/Reset buttons
- "End Task" button to manually complete a task

**Timer Presets:**
- 25|5 (default)
- 50|10
- 15|3
- Custom option (per task)

**Timer Behavior:**
- Use Web Workers for accurate timekeeping in background
- Auto-pause when tab is inactive or computer sleeps
- Option for auto-resume between sessions
- Visual theme changes between focus and break periods
- Sound notifications for session changes

**Procrastination Button:**
- Starts with a break timer first, then transitions to focus timer
- No special visual indicator needed in calendar view

**Focus Mode:**
- Hides all UI except the timer
- Automatically triggered for every focus session for a task once enabled
- Manual toggle option to disable

### Calendar Visualization

**Views:**
- Daily view (hour by hour, default 8AM-8PM but extends as needed)
- Weekly view (day by day)
- Navigation controls (previous/next, today, this week, next week)

**Display Features:**
- Shows tasks as discrete Pomodoro sessions (focus and break)
- Focus sessions colored according to task priority
- Break sessions shown in contrasting theme color
- Clear visual distinction between focus and break periods
- Tasks extending beyond active hours are displayed correctly
- Historical data retention with option to export

**Handling Overlapping Tasks:**
- Tasks shown in order of start time, then alphabetically
- All overlapping tasks remain visible in the calendar
- Pending task list shows waiting tasks
- Missed tasks highlighted in red and pinned to top of task list

### Data Management

**Storage Strategy:**
- Use browser localStorage for data persistence
- Regular auto-save to prevent data loss
- Manual export/import functionality for backup
- Structured data format for tasks and settings

**Settings Storage:**
